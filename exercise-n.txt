Exercise 1:
STEP 1:
	use decodemtl_addressbook // to switch to this database
STEP 2:
	SOURCE data/import-table-structure.sql // to import the data from the source required to database: data/import-table-structure.sql

	
Exercise 2:

Question 1:
Insert one row into decodemtl_addressbook.Account
Query Used:
1. drop table if exists Account; // to drop the previous table just to set a new table that has the same keys as the data imported
2. CREATE TABLE Account (
	id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	email VARCHAR(100),
	password VARCHAR(100),
	createdOn DATETIME,
	modifiedOn DATETIME
	);
	// to create a new table
3. INSERT INTO 'Account' ('...', '...') VALUE ('...', '...');

Question 2:
Insert one row into decodemtl_addressbook.AddressBook
Query Used:
1. ALTER TABLE AddressBook; // switch from the previous table to this table
2. drop table if exists Account; // to drop the previous table just to set a new table that has the same keys as the data imported
3. CREATE TABLE AddressBook (
	id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	accountId INT,
	name VARCHAR(100),
	createdOn DATETIME,
	modifiedOn DATETIME
	);
	// to create a new table
2. INSERT INTO 'AddressBook' ('...', '...') VALUE ('...', '...');

Question 3:
Insert three rows into decodemtl_addressbook.Entry
Query Used:
1. ALTER TABLE Entry; // switch from the previous table to this one
2. CREATE TABLE Entry (
	id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	addressBookId INT,
	firstName VARCHAR(100),
	lastName VARCHAR(100),
	birthday DATETIME,
	type ENUM('home', 'work', 'other'),
	subtype ENUM('phone', 'email', 'address'),
	contentLineOne VARCHAR(255),
	contentLineTwo VARCHAR(255),
	contentLineThree VARCHAR(255),
	contentLineFour VARCHAR(255),
	contentLineFive VARCHAR(255)
);
3. INSERT INTO Entry ('...', '...', '...')
VALUES ('...', '...', '...'),
	   ('...', '...', '...'),
	   ('...', '...', '...');
	   

Exercise 3:

Question 1:
Retrieve data from the previously inserted decodemtl_addressbook.Account row
Query Used:
SELECT * FROM + tableName;

Note: I realized that I did a mistake in Exercise 2 where it required me to insert only 1 row, but I copied 10 rows into my table.
So I have to delete the rest rows using query: DELETE FROM + tableName WHERE id BETWEEN "number" AND "number";


Exercise 4:

Question 1 - Question 3:

Answer:

For table Account and AddressBook that only contain 1 row, my queries are as below:
UPDATE "tableName" SET "key"="JoyEatTheWorld.corp" WHERE accountId=82;

For table Entry that contains multiple rows, my query is as below:
UPDATE Entry
    SET firstName = (case when addressBookId = 52 then 'Joy'
                         when addressBookId = 96 then 'Yumi'
                         when addressBookId = 43 then 'Izzie'
                    end),
        subtype = 'phone'
    WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
    

Exercise 5:
Delete all data from decodemtl_addressbook.Entry without using a DELETE statement
Answer:
truncate.Entry;


Exercise 6:
Delete decodemtl_addressbook.Account and all associated date
Answer:
drop table if exists Account;


Exercise 7:
Question1:
Import Database Schema from the following source file into decodemtl_addressbook_import:
data/import-table-structure.sql
Answer:
step 1: use decodemtl_addressbook_import // switch to database: decodemtl_addressbook_import
step 2: SOURCE data/import-table-structure.sql;

Question2:
Bulk import data from the following source files into decodemtl_addressbook_import:
data/import-account.sql
data/import-addressbook.sql
data/import-entry.sql

Comment: For this one, I tried to find a way that can import those three files into the db all at once,
I tried using cat "...sql", "...sql"...it doesn't work. So I had to do SOURCE 3 times.


Exercise 8:
Question1:
What is the email of the Account identified by "63"?
Answer:
SELECT email FROM Account WHERE id=63;

Question2:

Question3:
On which date was the AddressBook titled "Lorem Foundation" created?
Answer:
SELECT createdOn FROM AddressBook WHERE name="Lorem Foundation";


Exercise 9
How many Accounts exist? -1000 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Account;
How many Address Books exist? -1100 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM AddressBook;
How many Address Book Entries exist? -4000 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Entry;
